In this project, I developed ChronosTrade, a multi-modal stock market prediction framework that combines statistical time series modeling, deep learning, and natural language processing. The goal of my work was to study how historical price patterns and external textual sentiment signals can be integrated to improve financial forecasting.
Financial time series are stochastic, non-stationary, and influenced by both quantitative trends and qualitative information such as news and investor sentiment. To address these characteristics, I implemented three complementary approaches:
• ARIMA for linear statistical time series modeling
• LSTM neural networks for nonlinear sequential learning
• Sentiment analysis to incorporate exogenous textual signals
By progressively building from classical models to deep learning and hybrid architectures, I was able to analyze the strengths and limitations of each modeling paradigm.
